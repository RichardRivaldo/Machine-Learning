# Machine-Learning

Machine Learning models and its implementation with Python and R.

### Topics and Contents
This repo contains several topics, mainly in models of Machine Learning, including:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Regression
3. Classification
4. Clustering
5. Association Rule
6. Reinforcement Learning
7. Natural Language Processing
8. Deep Learning
9. Dimensionality Reduction
10. Model Selection

There are some small datasets to experiment on, also some documentations and self-taken notes in it.

### Environment
This code is purposely made in Spyder IDE so it contains *#%%* to make notebook cells.
Why Spyder?
1. Convenient and Practical
2. All-Rounder IDE
3. Cool and Adaptive Design

### Reference
Machine Learning A-Z

### Notes
* There are some intentionally left empty parts in the source codes to be filled with entries needed later.
* Make sure to download and install libraries needed for the computational processes in Spyder IDE.
