# Machine-Learning

Part of learning ML models and its implementation with Python (will try R later).

### Topics and Contents
This repo contains several topics, mainly in models of Machine Learning, including:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Regression
3. Classification
4. Clustering
5. Association Rule
6. Reinforcement Learning
7. Natural Language Processing
8. Deep Learning
9. Dimensionality Reduction
10. Model Selection

There are also some sample datasets to use as an experiment.

Also, there are some documentation and self-taken notes in it.

### Environment
This code is purposely made in Spyder IDE so it contains **#%%** to make notebook cells.
Why Spyder?
1. Convenient
2. All-Rounder 
3. Cool and Adaptive Design
